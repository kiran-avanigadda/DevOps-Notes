## Linux Notes

Linux is an open-source OS kernel based on UNIX principles.
- UNIX is licensed and developed by AT&T Bell labs.
- Linux is open-source and community driven.
- Distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Bebian are built on same kernel but differ in package management and User Interface (UI).
